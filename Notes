# Spiking Neural Net (SNN) Study Sheet 
### Overview
  **SNN**
- Type of artificial neural network that mimics biological neurons 
- Neurons communicate by sending discrete spikes at particular points in time 
- Sutiable for energy efficient and real time processing 


### Key concepts 
1. **Neurons and Spikes**
-**Neuron Model**: Represents the computation unit. 
-**Spike**: A discrete event representing a neuron firing 
-**Membrane Potential**: Voltage inside the neuron that determines if it fires a spike. 
-**Threshold**: The membrane potential level at which the  neuron fires a spike. 


2. **Neuron Models** 
-**Leaky-Integrated-and-Fire (LIF) Model:** Simple and commonly used neuon model. 
-**Hodgkin-Huxly- Model:** More biologically realistic but computationally expensive 
-**Izhikevich Model:** balances biological realism and computational efficiency 

3. **Synaptic Palsticity**
- **Spike-Timing Dependant Plasticity (STDP)**: Balance required for stable network behavior 
-**Hebbian Learning:** "Cells that fire together, wire together"

4. **Network Dynamics**
-**Excitatory and Inhibitor Neurons:** Balance required for stable network behavior 
-**Refractory Period:** Time after a neuron fires during which it cannot fire again.
